			<h1>I. Unsharp Masking Sharpen</h1>

				<p>
					Although it may seem counterintuitive, unsharp masking is actually a technique used to sharpen images. Unsharp masking is the technique of adding (some multiple alpha of) the high frequencies of an image to the original image, thus accentuating the high frequency components of the image. The high frequencies of the image, also called the Laplacian, is found by subtracting the low frequencies, which is found by smoothing the original image with a Gaussian filter, away from the original image.

					As can be observed from the series of images above, the higher the alpha, the more "sharp" the images become, though at a high enough alpha, some of the edges become white. Below are some close ups on the image above with more alpha values. I have decided that an alpha of 0.5 is the best.

			<h1>II. Hybrid Image</h1>

				<p>
					Hybrid images can be created by combining the high frequencies of one with the the low frequencies of another image. This can be accomplished because it's more difficult to distinguish high frequency feature from further away than low frequency features and vice versa. This means that if we are able to composite the high frequencies of one image onto the low frequencies of another image, we will create a hybrid image that looks like one thing from afar, and something else up close!
				</p>

				<p>
					Although it will be difficult to make out the details of the low frequency image from up close, it will still interfere with our view of the high frequency image. If the images are similar and aligned properly, this interferance is minimalized. I chose to use the images of a cake and a pie, since they're both vaguely ellipical.
				</p>

				<center>

							</td>
							<td>
								<img src="img/pie_fft.jpg">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>

				<p>
					I applied a low-pass filter, which is a standard 2D Gaussian filter (the same as the one from the previous section) of sigma <b>8</b>, to the cake, and a high-pass filter, which is the Laplacian (the Laplacian of the image is the original subtracted by the Gaussian-filtered image, also used in the previous section) of sigma <b>3</b>, to the pie. These sigma values are chosen through guessing and checking.
				</p>

								<img src="img/cake-pie_high-fft.jpg">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>

				<p>
					Beside these images are their the 2D Fourier transforms, which we can use to observe the effects of these filters and combinations. The pie's 2D Fourier transforms has rotated somewhat. Also, note how in the cake's 2D Fourier transforms how the low frequency values (white reprsents high frequency, and black represents low frequency) are eliminated.
				</p>

					</table>
				</center>

				<p>
					Woo! You can now look at both a cake and pie at the same time. This is what I call late night food blog browsing efficiency. But also look at the 2D Fourier transforms as well. We can see see both the low-pass and high-pass frequency images' features in it. Pretty neat!
				</p>

				<p>
					I also attempted to create an hybrid image of a shark and an image of a dolphin. I took care to pick images of the animals that matched in pose, since the high frequency features will still be visible from further away. (And then I remembered belatedly that sharks' tails don't work the same way as dolphins' do... derp. It was so much more difficult than I thought it would be.)
				</p>

								<img src="img/dolphin.jpg">
							</td>
							<td>
								<img src="img/shark.jpg">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>

				<p>
					However, as we can see from the results below, this did not work quite as well as I would have hoped. Since the sea around the image of the shark is dark coloured, just like the shark, there is not a lot of distinctive edges. With the shark going through the high-pass filter, portions of the tail and fin are barely distinct.
				</p>

				<p>
					I thought long and hard about what other images I wanted to create hybrids of. It hit me all of a sudden. I had an entire collection of selfies from my little sister, Nina. And her expressions are marvelous, I tell you. Actually, don't just take my word for it, feast your eyes upon them for you can find them below.

				<h2>Bells and Whistles</h2>

				<p>
					I also experimented with using colour Gaussian and Laplacians. Unfortunately, my first attempt used a relatively colour-less image with the high-pass filter. As you can see below, even when both filters allow for colour, there is not much difference compared to colour low-pass and grey high-pass.

							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>

				<p>
					I tried once again, swapping the images for low-pass and high-pass, since the image of Nina in the alarmingly blue sweater is quite colourful. Now, we can observe that when the high-pass image is in colour, the it creates an unappealing bright highlight on the low-pass image that does not go away even from far away. However, colour low-pass combined with grey high-pass works quite well, as the colour of Nina face is the same in both images, and that is the most prevalent colour in both images of Nina.

			<h1>III. Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks</h1>

				<p>
					Gaussian and Lacplacian stacks can be very useful when you need multiple Gaussians or Laplacians of a certain image with different sigmas, or frequency ranges. I chose to incrememnt sigma by a power of two between each level in the stack. (i.e. Level 1 has a sigma of 1, level 2 has a sigma of 2, level 3 has a sigma of 4, and so on.) Each level in the Gaussian is created simply by using the Gaussian filter on the image with the corresponding sigma. Each level in the Laplacian is created by subtracting the same level of the Gaussian stack by the level below it. (i.e. Laplacian4 = Gaussian3 - Gaussian4)

					Gaussian and Laplacian stacks can also be used to evalutate hybrid images, like the ones created from the previous part. The Gaussian takes only the low frequencies of an image, so the further up the Gaussian stack we go, the clearer the low frequency part of the image we will see. The Laplacian takes the high frequencies of an image, so the further up the Laplacian stack we go, the clearer the high frequency part of the image we will see.

			<h1>IV. Multiresolution Blending</h1>

				<p>
					Multiresoltion blending is the process of blending together two images seamlessly by computing its seam through separate high and low frequency calculations.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Gaussian and Laplacian stacks from the previous section will be used to compute stacks for the two images we want to merge. Another Gaussian stack also needs to be created of the image mask. The process is to sum over the each level in the Laplacian stack multiplied by the corresponding level in the mask Gaussian stack for each Laplacian stack. This will produce Laplacians for each image masked by our image mask. which is also a seamless combination of the images' high frequencies. The last step is to add the highest level Gaussian of the mask stack multiplied by the original images to to get a seamless combination of the images' low frequencies. This process is illustrated in the example below.
				</p>

				<p>
					I chose images of dogs from <a href="http://dogtime.com/" target="_blank">dogtime.com</a>, because the dogs in these images are in the same pose, and have white backgrounds. I manually aligned the two images and created a vertical mask in Photoshop. I ended up using <b>stack size 4</b>, just because it seemed the most seamless to me.

					To illustrate why I chose what stack size I chose for this spline, I created this series of images below. With stack size 1 through 3, the split between the two breeds is quite pronounced. However, with stack size 7 and 8, there is too many pixels get maxed out since we have to sum over so many levels of Laplacians. Of these, stack size 4 produced the most natural result.

					The resutling blend is created with stacks of size 3. Unfortunately, the texture of the otter's fur is just too different from Sherlock's hair for there to be any kind of seamless blend.

					I also blended two images of Capilano Suspension Bridge with size 8 stacks to make this pretty image below.

					I was also able to get these blended images to work with colour! I use colour for both the high frequency and low frequency blend and it worked without any other changes.

					I also wanted to attempt to blend three images together. This was also quite simple to achieve but simply creating a mask for each image. Before, with two images, the inverse of the mask was used for the second image. The three forests merged together was created with size 8 stacks.

			<h1>V. Conclusion</h1>

				<p>
					Although this project has me quite pressed for time, I liked this project very much overall. It's really hard to imagine photographs in separate frequencies, but this project helped me visualize it very clearly.
