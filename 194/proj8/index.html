			<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

				<p>
					As my final project(s), I did two of the provided list of pre-canned projects. Project 2 was a lot of fun and a nice change of pace, so I chose to do the Vertigo Shot project that is photography rather than code.
				</p>


			<h1>II. Fake Miniatures</h1>

				<p>
					The effect of making a scene look like a fake miniature is also called selective focus or tilt shift. This effect can be applied to an image by masking a region of interest and blurring the rest of the image. This narrows the perceived depth of field and creates the illusion that the lens was very close to the subject. This works best on images that already have a lot of depth, so you can choose to bring out one plane of this depth.
				</p>

				<p>
					Increasing the saturation in a fake miniature can enhance the effect and make the image look more toy-like. To increase the saturation, I converted the images from RGB to HSV and changed the saturation values. At first I simply set the saturation value for each pixel to 1. This made the colours disproportionally saturated throughout the image, which is especially evident with the cups. I then tried to add .5 to each saturation value which made it a little bit better. Finally, I figured out that if I just multiply each saturation value by 2, the values will become proportionally more saturated.

				<p>
					Although the project specs said that my program should be able to set a focus line through selecting points, I think that just the y-value of one point is necessary as the line is just a straight horizontal line. So, instead of having a point selection window when the program is run, I placed a variable <span class="code">focus_y</span> that can be set to whatever y-value we want the focus line to be on.
				</p>

				<p>
					The original is below the varations in <span class="code">dof_size</span>, which determines where the blurring around focus line should start, and <span class="code">saturation</span>, which determines how much saturation to increase, next to the final fake miniature for easy comparison. I set <span class="code">focus_y = 200</span>, a value I found works best for this image through experimentation.

				<p><b>Fake Stop Motion</b></p>

				<p>
					Stop motion is a type of animation that uses photographs of objects that appear to move in between frames by small increments. Since the process of fake miniatures make large objects look like small, stop motion figures, we can use several of these fake miniature images to simulate a stop motion animation by simply processing the series of images the same way.
				</p>

				<p>
					I did this shot from the terrace next to Davis Hall with my iPhone propped up on the railing. Unfortunately that meant that camera moved a little between each shot so the animation is a little wobbly.

			<h1>III. Vertigo Shot</h1>

				<p>
					A vertigo shot, also called a dolly zoom, is the camera effect popularized in the Hitchcock movie, Vertigo. It is achieved by zooming in a zoom lens while moving away from the subject, and also keeping the subject the same size in the frame throughout the entire shot. The background and foreground will change while the subject in focus changes, creating a distortion in perspective. Although this effect is usually done with videos, I will take a series of images instead and then string them into a gif.
				</p>

				<p>
					My first series of images are of some bottles of nail polish on my desk. I used a strip of masking tape to keep my camera moving in a straight line and let the camera rest on the table so that there will be minimal rotation.

				<p><b>Moving the Subject vs. Moving the Camera</b></p>

				<p>
					Instead of moving the camera, as I did with the earlier shots, I did a shot keeping the camera fixed and instead moving the subject between each picture. I, once again, chose to use my nail polish as my subject. It turned out to be a good decision because of the bottle's shape. I was able to use gridlines to align the sides of the bottle as well as align the face of the bottle directly towards the camera.
				</p>

				<center>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<img src="img/move/00.jpg">
							</td>
							<td>
								<img src="img/move/01.jpg">
							</td>
							<td>
								<img src="img/move/02.jpg">

						</tr>
						<tr>

						<tr>
							<td colspan="3">

							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>

				<p>
					Although the effect is quite similar, we can see that the surface that the subject rests on is obviously moving rather than shifting in perspective. Also, I was not perfect in positioning the bottle, so you can see that in some frames, the bottle is not in quite the correct rotation. I thought that the shifting surface was very cool, so I definitely prefer moving the camera to moving the subject.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p><b>Digital Zoom Experiment</b></p>

				<p>
					I was told that I had to use a camera with a real zoom lens for this project, so obviously I had to do the exact opposite and figure out why. Optical zoom and digital zoom are very different, I discovered. Digital is basically just a cropped version of some image, so resolution is lost. Optical zoom actually changed the focal length of the camera, so no resolution is lost. Pretty cool!

				<p>
					iPhones only have digital zoom, but the low resolution isn't too horrendous. The most "zoomed in" image is definitely grainy and blurry. Although the quality of this shot is not the best, I was able to go in on Photoshop and align and crop each image so that it matches the previous one. The gif sequence does look a lot smoother as a result.
				</p>


			<h1>VII. Conclusion</h1>

				<p>
					These projects were a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed doing the Vertigo Shot. I am usually quite happy with the photos I can get with my iPhone, but taking photos with a real camera is really quite a different experience.
