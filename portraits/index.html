					<h1>Hello Stranger</h1>
					<p>
						Two weeks ago I embarked upon a perilous journey frought with uncertainties. My goal was to draw portraits of strangers and give them those portraits. I set out, armed with my sticky note pads, a collection of pens, and my trusty whiteboard with the words "Free Art" strewn across it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Drawing portraits of strangers is not new to me; I have been sketching people from afar for a long time. There have been moments of awkward eye contact, but very rarely have I ever interacted with those I drew.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose to set up shop at Sather Gate simply because I knew there will always be a large amount of people walking by. I was timid at first, but my fear of interaction proved unfounded. Nobody stopped to ask for a portrait. Nobody even bothered to read my sign. I felt invisible.
					</p>
					<p>
						My frustration made me bold and I started calling out to those who passed. Finally, I had my first interaction.

					<h1>A Battle Won</h1>
					<p>
						My friend, Paul Moulton (who is also the amazing photographer that took these beautiful photos), jokingly called the exchange between me and those who take part in my project an art battle. While the exchanges well much more friendly than would be required for a battle, there was certainly a battle that was waged. One that warred on within me.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was frightful, the first couple of times. Talking to people is not my forte; talking to strangers straight up frightens me. It got easier to talk to these strangers, to ask them their names and their hobbies and about their day.
