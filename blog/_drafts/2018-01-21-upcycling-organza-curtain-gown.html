	I absolutely love wearing fancy dresses.

	I walked around the store in search of a perfect embroidered tulle but came up empty handed. Just as I was about to leave in defeat, I spotted these boxes of old curtains under a display at the register. Although they were musty, there was a good selection of organza. I was particularly taken by the pink and dusty pink fabrics, and at $3.98 a piece, it was an easy purchase.

	Unfortunately, there were some rips and holes in some of the fabrics. But, that's only to be expected in used materials, and I can easily cut around the imperfections.

	Since I am now using a different fabric than what I had initially designed for, I had to go back to the drawing board.
