	<b>A bonus of using used fabrics is that they are generally already hemmed.</b>  If I can be a little clever with how I reuse this fabric and its hem, I would be able to skip hemming altogether. Hemming is incredibly time consuming (as I was about to find out), so you should thank your lucky stars for whatever hemming you can get out of. In the case of this rectangle skirt test, I used the hemmed side of the fabric as the bottom of the skirt, thus eliminating the need to hem there!

	<b>Hemming</b> is a way of finishing a cloth edge by folding the raw edge in twice to create a hem and sewing along the hem to keep the folds in place. <b>Finishing</b> a seam means to use some kind of method that secures and neatens the raw edges of a fabric to prevent fraying and unraveling of the fabric. I'll talk (read: complain) a lot more about hemming in the next blog post with pictures, so don't worry if this doesn't make too much sense.

	In order to cut out pieces of fabric <i>efficiently</i>, I had to make a pattern. A <b>pattern</b> is a multi-piece template that will construct into a piece of clothing. I used a large sheet of butcher paper to create a triangle
