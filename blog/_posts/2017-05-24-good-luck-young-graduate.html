	Some of you may know, I graduated from UC Berkeley a week ago. After all the commotion of celebration, visiting family, and moving out/in has died down, I have encountered a weird stretch of peace and quiet. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I have <i>spare time</i>. It's honestly gotten me quite befuddled. What am I supposed to do with all this time?
