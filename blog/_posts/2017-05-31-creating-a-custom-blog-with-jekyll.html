<p>
	The thought of starting a blog has beeen running through my mind for quite a while now. Now that I've finally got the time for it (I just graduated!) I figure it's time to finally act on the idea. I hope to write about my experiments and side projects (for both code and art), so keep an eye out! Regardless of future plans, the first order of business is, of course, actually creating a blog, which brings us to where we are now.
</p>

<p>
	I've considering using a blogging platform like Wordpress or Tumblr and either embedding it into my website or simply linking to an external like Medium. Ultimately, after doing some research and consulting my friends for advice, (thanks Arlan!) I decided on building my own blog with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. The benefits are two-fold: I get to have full control over customizing the look of my blog, and it also gives me an opportunity to learn something new (and blog about it).
</p>

<p>
	My web experience is not extensive: it consists mostly of plain HTML and CSS static sites that I build for fun, mixed with some Meteor and React. Learning something new on my own is always daunting, but luckily there are a lot of good tutorials floating around on the internet. That being said, what I write is entirely from bashing random keys and booping questionable buttons, so if something isn't quite right, please let me know!
</p>

<p>
	I'll be walking through my process of creating this custom Jekyll blog in this post. Of course, there are plenty of <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/" target="_blank">Jekyll themes</a> out there, if you want something quick. My goal here is to learn to do it myself, so I can use these tools to create exactly what I want. Hopefully it'll help you do the same!
</p>



<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Make a blog with Jekyll</b> that supports:</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Tags</b> or categories</li>
			<li>Comments</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Must have <b>seamless integration</b> into the rest of my website</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the same templates, CSS, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

<p>
	Note: I do gloss over all the HTML and CSS details, so you'll need some understanding of those to follow along.
</p>



<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>
	Installing Jekyll was quite straightforward. Jekyll's documentation has a easy to follow <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/" target="_blank">installation guide</a>, and should have everything you need.
</p>

<p>
	We'll be creating a brand new Jekyll site that has a blog. We can then throw in whatever existing CSS and other pages that you want from your original site. (You'll see that I use the same <span class="code">index.html</span> and all other pages and assets that I simply copied over from my original site.) If you want, you can even convert everything over to use Jekyll layouts, which is what I ended up doing!
</p>

<p>
	Getting Jekyll up and running is pretty simple, too. I poked around their default template to figure out what everything does, but started with a blank Jekyll site for my blog.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Create a new blank slate Jekyll site and the dir for it to live in: mysite
jekyll new mysite --blank

# Go into the directory
cd mysite</pre>

<p>
	Here are some basic usage commands:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Build the site into _site
jekyll build

# Build the site and preview it on your local web server at localhost:4000
jekyll serve</pre>

<p>
	Your shiny new site should be up and running at <a href="localhost:4000" target="_blank">localhost:4000</a> until you use <span class="code">ctrl-c</span> to kill the server from that same terminal. As you can see, the webpage is entirely blank. (Good!) Jekyll is probably complaining about <span class="code">Configuration file: none</span> in your terminal, which we'll fix prompty.
</p>



<h2 id="site-anatomy">Site Anatomy</h2>

<p>
	Our initialized Jekyll site is quite bare bones, and we'll have to add a bunch of folders and files to what's been created for us. First, it's important to understand the structure of it all.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Jekyll blank site directory structure
mysite
├── _drafts
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _site		# This won't exist if you didn't try to build/serve the site
│   └── index.html
└── index.html</pre>

<p>
	<b>What does build mean?</b> This directory that we have here is really just a bucket of information that Jekyll uses to build your website. You tell it what you want, and boom, it generates all the HTML and CSS that your audience actually sees and puts it in <span class="code">_site</span>.
</p>

<p>
	<b>What's all this weird underscore stuff?</b> That's all the stuff that does not directly compose our built site. That would be things like templates that are the buidling blocks of the site.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Where do I put my assets and other pages?</b> Everything that's not prepended with an underscore is copied over into <span class="code">_site</span> exactly where you put it. (e.g. <span class="code">/index.html</span> will end up as <span class="code">/_site/index.html</span>)
</p>

<p>
	Now, let's add a couple new files and folders into the mix...
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
mysite
├── _config.yml	# New
├── _drafts
├── _includes		# New
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _sass		# New
├── _site		# This is automatically created for you in the build process
├── blog 		# New
│   └── index.html
├── css 		# New
│   └── styles.css
└── index.html</pre>

<p>
	The Jekyll documentation's <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/" target="_blank">directory structure</a> page has more in depth descriptions, but here's a quick run down:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="code">_config.yml</span> - This is where all the important configuration information (site title, url, etc.) regarding your entire site lives. Jekyll uses this information to compile your site properly.</li>
	<li><span class="code">_drafts</span> - This is where all your unpublished posts live. Delete it if you'd like.</li>
	<li><span class="code">_includes</span> - This is where our partials live. That would be the headers, footers, etc. that can be repeated throughout our site.</li>
	<li><span class="code">_layouts</span> - Layouts live here.</li>
	<li><span class="code">_posts</span> - Published posts live here.</li>
	<li><span class="code">_scss</span> - Sass partials live here. This is NOT where your main SCSS/CSS lives, just the stuff that you would like imported into it.</li>
	<li><span class="code">_site</span> - Your generated site lives here.</li>
	<li><span class="code">blog</span> - I like to keep a separate folder with all the blog related pages and assets to keep my directory clean and separated from the rest of my site.</li>
	<li><span class="code">css/...</span> - This is where your actual CSS files live. Note that there is no underscore prepended to this dir name, so it will be copied into your compiled site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course, create your <span class="code">.gitignore</span> if you need/want to. Mine looks something like this:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
.DS_Store
.jekyll-metadata
.sass-cache/
_site/</pre>

<p>
	
</p>

<p>
	Next, let's take a look at that configuration file. This is where we configure the entire Jekyll site. For all available options, take a peek at the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/" target="_blank">configuration docs</a>. Here is a really basic <span class="code">_config.yml</span> file:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
title: Emilee Chen
baseurl: ""
url: "http://emileechen.com"
permalink: pretty

css: "/css/styles.css"
favicon: "/favicon.png"

navlinks:
  - name: work
    url: "/"
  - name: about
    url: "/about"
  - name: blog
    url: "/blog"

sass:
  sass_dir: _sass</pre>

<p>
	For our purposes, none of these settings are <i>really</i> necessary besides the sass directory (if you're going to use <a href="#sass">sass</a>). This file makes it very easy to customize a Jekyll template, and it's good practice to centralize all your info here. We can also easily <a href="#variables">access this info</a> as variables to use anywhere on our site. I put a list of the links I want in my navbar as well as the CSS stylesheet and favicon paths here for that reason.
</p>



<h2 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h2>

<p>
	Before we can do anything Jekyll related, we must know about front matter. It's <u>Very Important</u> for Jekyll to function and build your site properly.
</p>

<p>
	When Jekyll builds, it goes through all the files in your main directory and looks for something called a front matter block. It's <b>denoted and bounded by a set of triple dashes</b> and <b>must be placed at the very beginning of a file</b>. If a front matter block exists, Jekyll will processes the file (by reading it as a layout, shoving the page into a layout, filling in all the placeholder variables, etc.).
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">
---
# You can insert comments

# And assign some useful predefined variables like...

# Specifying a layout: (we'll talk about how to create layouts next)
layout: default

# Specifying a permalink: (to ignore the actual location and define a new URL)
permalink: /blog/

# Specifying a title:
title: The Coolest Blog

# Even assign custom variables like so:
jive: some potentially useful information
---</pre>

<p>
	Read more about this in the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/" target="_blank">front matter docs</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>

<p>
	It's finally time to work on how our blog looks! Like I said earlier, I'm writing this guide with the goal of integrating this blog into a preexisting site. My current site template consists of a header, which also holds the navigaton, a footer, and some content. You should figure out sections for your layout however you see fit.
</p>

<div class="img-table">
	<div class="img-table-box">
		<div class="img-table-item">
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/img/site-layout-labels.png">
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="img-table attach">
	<div class="img-table-box">
		Basic layout of my site.
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Layouts live in... *drumroll* ... <span class="code">_layouts</span>. Crazy how that one works, eh? Anyway, layouts are exactly what you would expect. They describe the skeleton of a page that we can later use to fill out with actual content. You can make as many layouts as you'd like, though it's a good idea to reuse templates to keep your site cohesive.
</p>


<h3>/_layouts/default.html</h3>

<p>
	Our first layout is <span class="code">default.html</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint language-html">{% raw %}---
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  {% include head.html %}		# Insert head tag
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      {% include header.html %}		# Insert a header here
        <div class="main">
          {{ content }}			# Insert content here
        </div>
      {% include footer.html %}		# Insert a footer here
    </div>
    {% include scripts.html %}		# Insert scripts here
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
</xmp>

<p>
	<b>What are all these curly brackets?!</b> Don't freak out! That's Liquid, a templating language. I'll go over it more in a bit. For now, just know that <span class="code">&lbrace;% include filename.html %&rbrace;</span> inserts the specified HTML include file (files that live in <span class="code">_includes</span>), and <span class="code">&lbrace;&lbrace; content &rbrace;&rbrace;</span> is where content get referenced and inserted when this layout is used.
</p>

<p>
	<b>What if I don't have any scripts?</b> Then remove <span class="code">&lbrace;&lbrace;% include scripts.html %&rbrace;&rbrace;</span>, and don't make a <span class="code">scripts.html</span>. Make and include what elements make sense for your layout, and no more!
</p>

<p>
	Remember! Jekyll won't know that this is something it should process if you don't put in a front matter block!
</p>


<h3>/_layouts/post.html</h3>

<p>
	Besides the default layout, we also need a layout for blog posts. I named this layout <span class="code">post.html</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint language-html">{% raw %}---
layout: default					# Use the default layout as a template
---

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>			# Display the title of my post

<p class="blog-post-info">
  {{ page.date | date: '%a, %b %d, %Y' }}	# Display the published date of my post
</p>

{{ content }}					# Blog post content will be inserted here!
{% endraw %}
</xmp>

<p>
	<b>Use the default layout?</b> Yup, layouts can use other layouts, too. Here, we build our post layout off of our default layout. It just means we replace <span class="code">&lbrace;&lbrace; content &rbrace;&rbrace;</span> of the default layout with this layout and use the resulting combined layout as our post layout. (Whew... say that three times fast...)
</p>

<p>
	<b>Err... <span class="code">&lbrace;&lbrace; page.variable &rbrace;&rbrace;</span>?</b> Every blog post that you publish will have a independent page using this layout, and Liquid lets us grab variables from posts. <span class="code">| date: '%a, %b %d, %Y'</span> is a filter (in this case, a date formatting filter applied on <span class="code">page.date</span>), which will also be explained later.
</p>



<h2 id="includes">Includes</h2>

<p>
	While layouts help us keep the layout of our site/blog consistent, includes help us keep content persistent through all our pages consistent. This would be anything from navbars to scripts. As you can see from the default layout that we've just created, I need to make <span class="code">head.html</span>, <span class="code">header.html</span>, <span class="code">footer.html</span>, and <span class="code">script.html</span> include pages.
</p>

<p>
	 Jekyll will freak out about being unable to "locate the included file" if you try to reference an include file that you have not created!
</p>


<h3>/_includes/head.html</h3>

<p>
	Our first include file is <span class="code">head.html</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}<head>
  <title>{{ site.title }}</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.css | prepend: site.baseurl }}"> 
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="{{ site.favicon | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</head>{% endraw %}</xmp>

<p>
	We put the browser title here, and reference our CSS and favicon here, as you would expect.
</p>


<h3>/_includes/header.html</h3>

<p>
	<span class="code">header.html</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}<div class="header-bar">
  <div class="header-bar-left">
    <div class="header-bar-title">
      <a href="/">Emilee Chen</a>
    </div>
    <div class="header-bar-subtitle">
      Software Engineer
    </div>
  </div>
  {% include nav.html %}
</div>{% endraw %}</xmp>

<p>
	Yup, your include can include other includes if you want.
</p>


<h3>/_includes/nav.html</h3>

<p>
	<span class="code">nav.html</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}<div class="nav">
  {% for link in site.navlinks %}		# Grab that list of links from _config.yml
    {% if page.title == link.name %}		# If the current page has the same title as this link...
      <div class="nav-btn current">{{ link.name | capitalize }}</div>
    {% else %}					# If this is a link to a different page...
      <a href="{{ link.url }}">
        <div class="nav-btn click">{{ link.name | capitalize }}
          <div class="btn-underline"></div>
        </div>
     </a>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>{% endraw %}</xmp>

<p>
	As you can see by now, Liquid allows us to use if else clauses and for loops, which reduces repeating code greatly. Here, I am looping over a list of links, and either using plain text or an active link depending on whether or not the current page has the same title as the link by comparing <span class="code">page.title</span> and <span class="code">link.name</span>.
</p>


<h3>/_includes/footer.html</h3>

<p>
	<span class="code">footer.html</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}<div class="footer">
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emileechen/" class="icon">
    <i class="fa fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
  <a href="https://github.com/emileechen" class="icon">
    <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emileechen" class="icon">
    <i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</div>{% endraw %}</xmp>

<p>
	I have a simple, linked three icon footer that uses <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> icons.
</p>



<h2 id="variables">Variables and Liquid</h2>

<p>
	Jekyll uses <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki" target="_blank">Liquid</a> to allow us to access all kinds of variables using Liquid <i>objects</i> and do all kinds of fun stuff with <i>tags</i> and <i>filters</i>.
</p>

<p>
	To render a variable, wrap it with <span class="code">{% raw %}{{ }}{% endraw %}</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}{{ content }}
{{ site.title }}
{{ page.excerpt }}{% endraw %}</xmp>


<p>
	Basic programming logic tags are wrapped with <span class="code">{% raw %}{% %}{% endraw %}</span>:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}{% if %}
{% else %}
{% endif %}

{% assign var = 'some value you want to store' %}

{% for i in (1..n) %}
  {{ i }}<br>
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}</xmp>

<p>
	Read about variables in the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/" target="_blank">Jekyll variables doc</a> and about Liquid syntax in the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid docs</a>. There are also a lot of cheatsheets online. I particularly enjoy <a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">CloudCannon's Jekyll Cheat Sheet</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>

<p>
	Our Jekyll blog will have three types of pages: the main page with a list of blog posts, our actual blog post pages, and a tags page with a list of tags and their corresponding blog posts.
</p>

	<h3>Main Blog Page</h3>

	<p>
		This will be where our audience will land when they click on the <b>Blog</b> link in our navbar. Here we want to display and link to each blog post. We can use a for loop to automatically populate this page with all the posts.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="code">/blog/index.html</span>:
	</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">{% raw %}---
layout: default
title: My Very Cool Blog
permalink: /blog/
---

{% for post in site.posts %}		<!-- Loop through all the posts in blog/_posts/ -->
  <div class="blog-container">		<!-- A div container to wrap around each listing -->

    <!-- Header with post title, category, and date -->
    <div class="blog-header">
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">
        <div class="blog-title">

          {{ post.title }}

          <span class="blog-info">
            <span class="fa fa-folder-open" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            {{ post.category | upcase }}
            <span class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            {{ post.date | date: '%a, %m/%d/%y' }}
          </span>

        </div>
      </a>
    </div>

    <!-- Throw in an excerpt and another link to the post -->
    <div class="blog-excerpt">
      {{ post.excerpt }}
      <p class="blog-read-more"><a href="{{ post.url }}">Read more</a></p>
    </div>

  </div>
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}</xmp>

	<p>
		This HTML file may seem meaty, but most of it is just nesting div containers to stylize this page properly. The most important thing to note is the for loop, <span class="code">{% raw %}{% for post in site.posts %} ... {% endfor %}{% endraw %}</span>. <b>Everything within the opening and closing tags will be repeated for each post.</b> It also allows us access to variables (title, date, category, etc.) that we will be included in each blog post HTML we write. You can even get all kind of fancy with your formatting (cover photos for each post, hover animations, etc.).
	</p>

	<p>
		Jekyll conveiently already has a notion of post excerpts, which is defaulted to the first paragraph of your blog post. This can also be manually overriden if you'd like. Read more about that on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#post-excerpts" target="_blank">Jekyll's Post excerpts doc</a>.
	</p>


	<h3>Post Pages</h3>

	<p>
		All of our blog posts that we want published to our site will live in <span class="code">/blog/_posts/</span>. If you want a safe place to house your drafts, they can go in <span class="code">/blog/_drafts/</span>, where the contents will not be built out. For Jekyll to build your blog posts properly, each file much be named appropriately in this format: <span class="code">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="code">/blog/_posts/2017-05-31-my-first-blog-post.html</span>:
	</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">---
layout:   post
title:    "My First Blog Post"
date:     2018-01-15 05:41:26 -0700
category: personal
tags:     [fun]
---

<p>
  Some really cool content.
</p></xmp>

	<p>
		Once again, the front matter is <u>Very Important</u>! It holds all the variables that we were accessing from the list of posts earlier. I decided to organize my posts in two ways: categories and tags. The category will only appear with each post. The tags will be clickable and will take you to the Tags Page. You can of course do yours however you like. The variables are not special keywords so you can customize them as well.
	</p>


	<h3>Tags Page</h3>

	<p>
		<span class="code">/blog/tags.html</span>:
	</p>



<h2 id="sass">Sass</h2>

<p>
	Jekyll will compile your SCSS file at <span class="code">css/styles.scss</span> into a CSS file at <span class="code">_site/css/styles.css</span>.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-yaml">---
---

@import "variables";</pre>

<p>
	Remember to <b>include a front matter block</b> (the triple dashes) at the top of your SCSS file. Otherwise your file won't be compiled.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, you can just write a plain CSS stylesheet if you'd like. A plain CSS stylesheet won't need ot be compiled by Jekyll, so the front matter block won't be necessary. I prefer SCSS for its nesting and variables functionality.
</p>
